## Keccak SHA-3 algorithm for Proof of Work (PoW)
---
Maxcoins transaction security has been upgraded with next-generation, Keccak SHA-3 algorithm for Proof of Work. 
Whilst SHA-2 was designed and developed closed-door by the NSA, Keccak was subject to an open competition with design and peer preview (NIST).

Keccak was also chosen as the official successor for SHA-256 after being a finalist and finally winning a 5 year long international competition run by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and as such chosen as the successor to SHA-256.

Special Note: Keccak is also much greener than SHA-256 and many other hashing functions, reducing cryptocurrencies ecological footprint."

#### Keccak/SHA3 Info:
  * Winner of 5 year long NIST competition
  * Next-generation encryption
  * Official Successor to SHA-256
  * Not developed closed doors by NSA
  * Open Peer Reviewed & Designed
  * Not length-extension attacks vulnerable
  * Thicker safety margin than SHA-2
  * Greener than SHA-256

## Schnorr Signing Algorithm
---
Maxcoin addresses use Schnorr for signing algorithm allowing exciting developments such as “native multisig” to be used, and an upgraded cryptographic field for key generation and an increase in performance.

Maxcoin uses Secp256r1 as it’s cryptographic field to generate key pairs for addresses: A carefully-designed elliptical curve from which points are selected and used to initialise the public and private keys. 

The use of the Secp256k1 field is specifically recommended by NIST, an organisation that sets the standards for US government cryptography.

#### Digital Signature:
  * Includes “Native Multisig”
  * A future feature for Bitcoin
  * Uses Secp256r1 (NIST recommended)
  * Increased Performance
  * Increased Scalability
  * Anti-Spam Attacks
  * Interactive Signature Aggregation
