### Wallets 
---
Maxcoin Core Contributors are welcome to work on an iOS and Android wallet, but we are also interested in working closely with 3rd Party Wallets where your wallets will be introduced to our growing Maxcoin community.

> Special Note Regarding Wallet Sync Time:
>
>  It can take upto 7 days or longer for the Maxcoin QT wallet to sync due to 4 years + of blockchain transactions.
>  If you would like to install the full node with rapid syncing, we recommend that you use one of the following methods.
>  We encourage the community to sync, seed and share the following p2p solutions.
