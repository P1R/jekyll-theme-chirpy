## Wallets 
---
Maxcoin Core Contributors are welcome to work on an iOS and Android wallet, but we are also interested in working closely with 3rd Party Wallets where your wallets will be introduced to our growing Maxcoin community.

> Note: You can also build the wallet yourself by downloading the Compressed Source Code from the [zip](https://github.com/Max-Coin/maxcoin/archive/refs/tags/v0.9.4.2.zip), [tar.gz](https://github.com/Max-Coin/maxcoin/archive/refs/tags/v0.9.4.2.tar.gz) file or by cloning the [Latest Release](https://github.com/Max-Coin/maxcoin/releases/download/v0.9.4.2/) git repository.


*** Other Maxcoin Wallets:***

Name      | Operating System | Type       | Note
Paper Wallet | [WEB](https://github.com/Max-Coin/paper-wallet-generator)  | Paper Wallet | Retiring 
Maxcoin IPFS Paper Wallet | WEB | IPFS | Soon

## Options to sync faster with the blockchain
While we work on growing and decentralizing maxcoin further (dnsseeds, tor, ipfs, etc..) and speed up the blockchain syncing, we understand the current builds do not have the speed required to get the blockchain, and thus we have faster sync solutions, yet we still encourage people to use the old way and let the wallet sync by its own (3 weeks) to enhance security.

There are two ways to speed things up, that are:
1. Bootstrap image. (approx. 10 days to sync)
2. Latest Blockchain automatic backups. (approx. 10 hours to sync)

### 1. Bootstrap image. (approx. 10 days to sync)

1. Download the latest MaxCoin bootstrap.dat.zip: 
  * [miror1](http://bootstrap.getmaxcoin.com)
  * [miror2](http://bootstrap.maxcoinproject.org)

2. Verify the hash corresponds to `1cdfe13c910a433136f474704531ab5a0461715478c2fefb42db77da360b0af5`
Execute the following command to the downloaded file:

```sh
$ sha256sum bootstrap.dat.zip 
1cdfe13c910a433136f474704531ab5a0461715478c2fefb42db77da360b0af5  bootstrap.dat.zip
``` 
> Note: if the hash is diferent from this one, do not follow up and contact us at the [telegram channel](https://t.me/maxcoinproject)

3. move the file to your home directory, extract the file and set it into the config directory
```sh
$cd ~ && unzip bootstrap.dat.zip && mv bootstrap.dat ~/.maxcoin/ 
```
4. execute the maxcoin-qt wallet and Syncing should start working
```sh
$cd ~/maxcoin && ./maxcoin-qt  
```
>Note: For Windows based systems follow up this tutorial [Bitcoin Bootstrap.dat - Where to find and how to use Bootstrap.dat file](https://coinguides.org/bitcoin-bootstrap-dat-source-usage/)

### 2. Latest Blockchain automatic backups. (approx. 10 hours to sync)

1. Download the latest [MaxCoin BlockChain](http://blockchain.getmaxcoin.com)
2. Verify the hash corresponds to `6d73ef55cc7f1964bea3da875cb0aff1a992ffd9325dd81c2645fd290c20db38`
Execute the following command to the downloaded file:

```sh
$sha256sum maxcoinBlockChainBack-1651801511.tar.xz 
6d73ef55cc7f1964bea3da875cb0aff1a992ffd9325dd81c2645fd290c20db38  maxcoinBlockChainBack-1651801511.tar.xz
``` 
> Note: if the hash is diferent from this one, do not follow up and contact us at the [telegram channel](https://t.me/maxcoinproject)

3. move the file to your home directory and extract the file
```sh
$cd ~ && tar xvf maxcoinBlockChainBack-1651801511.tar.xz  
```
4. execute the maxcoin-qt wallet
```sh
$cd ~/maxcoin && ./maxcoin-qt  
```

> Special Note Regarding Wallet Sync Time:
>
>  It can take upto 7 days or longer for the Maxcoin QT wallet to sync due to 4 years + of blockchain transactions.
>  If you would like to install the full node with rapid syncing, we recommend that you use one of the following methods.
>  We encourage the community to sync, seed and share the following p2p solutions.
