# Website navigation based on user types

The goal is to analyze the maxcoin users type and what type of requirements for consulting maxcoin website they might have. We intend to make the website developers oriented, in order to attract more developers into the project.

* Users/Investors/HODLers (Pasive)
    require: 
    * Documentation
    * FAQ
    * Explorer

* Traders (Pasive)
    require: 
    * Documentation?
    * Explorer
    * Features
    * Summary
    * RELASE DATES (No DATES)

* Community (Active)
    require: 
    * Documentation (Governance, Support, etc..)
    * FAQ
    * Social Media
    * Profiles or anon?
    * Organization
    * Manifesto and Philosophy

* Governance (Active)
  require: 
    * Documentation (Governance, Support, etc...)
    * Trust or proof of beeing active
    * Organization
    * Profiles or anon?
    * Manifesto and Philosophy

* Developers (Priority + Active)
    require: 
    * Documentation
    * wbsite sources (git, testnet explorer, etc.)
    * Development tools (Projects, Wallets, Dapps, MIP)

# Website navigation to simplified fit everything 

A simple structure to fit everything for everyone 

> In the current Website we see to many options:
> * Home (Landing Page must be there)
> * Features
> * Community
> * Roadmap
> * Downloads
> * Mining 
> * Exchanges 
> * Explorers
> * Media

# Documentation based on UserTypes and Labels

> based on the user types and labels I propose two types of browsing for documentation which are the following:

1. **By UserTypes**
   We can create Sections for the most active types of users but also a FAQ and simple abstract version for pasive users.

2. **By Labels**
   We create labels per article so that we have a better way to access or manage acording to the amount of article types and specific research areas.
